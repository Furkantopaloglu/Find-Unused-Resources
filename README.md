## ✨ Why Flutter Find Unused Resources?

Every Flutter project accumulates technical debt over time — forgotten assets, abandoned classes, deprecated methods, and unused packages quietly bloat your app's size and slow down your team. **Flutter Find Unused Resources** gives you X-ray vision into your codebase and your builds, so you can cut the fat and deliver a leaner, faster app to your users.

> ⚡ No more guessing. No more manual searches. Just clean, optimized Flutter code.

## 🎯 Features

### 🧹 Source Code Cleanup

Automatically detect dead code lurking in your Flutter project — all from a dedicated panel inside VS Code.

- 🔍 **Unused Classes** — Instantly find classes defined but never referenced anywhere in your project.
- 🔧 **Unused Methods** — Surface methods that are declared but never called.
- 📦 **Unused Packages** — Identify `pubspec.yaml` dependencies you're importing but not actually using.
- 🖼️ **Unused Assets** — Spot image, font, and file assets declared in `pubspec.yaml` that no code ever loads.
- 🖱️ **Click-to-Navigate** — Click any detected issue in the tree view to instantly jump to the exact file and line — no manual searching required.
- ⚡ **Powered by Dart CLI** — Analysis runs via a robust background Dart CLI tool, delivering accurate, project-wide results without slowing down your editor.

### 📊 Build Size Analysis

Stop wondering what's eating your app's megabytes. Analyze your existing **APK** or **IPA** file in seconds — no rebuild needed.

- 📂 **Zero Rebuild Required** — Point the extension at an already-built `.apk` or `.ipa` file and get instant insights.
- 🎯 **Smart File Picker** — The built-in file picker filters exclusively for `.apk` and `.ipa` extensions so you always load the right file.
- 🥧 **Animated Pie Chart** — A gorgeous, Chart.js-powered interactive pie chart breaks down your app's composition by category:
  - 🎨 Assets
  - ⚙️ Native Code
  - 🎯 Dart Code
  - ...and more
- 🏆 **Top 5 Heaviest Files** — A detailed table highlights the five largest contributors to your build size, so you know exactly where to focus your optimization efforts.
- 🖥️ **Beautiful Dashboard** — Results are presented in a sleek Webview Panel dashboard directly inside VS Code — no browser, no external tools.
